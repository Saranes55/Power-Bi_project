# Personal Finance Management Analysis

## Project Overview

The Finance Report Dashboard is an interactive analytics project designed to provide a complete view of income, expenses, and financial performance over a year.

The dashboard helps users:

- Track total income vs expenses
- Monitor monthly spending patterns
- Analyze category-wise and sub-category-wise expenses
- Measure financial health using KPIs

This project demonstrates my ability to transform raw financial data into meaningful insights using data modeling, KPIs, and effective visual storytelling.
